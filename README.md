# HackFS-2022


[Fluence](https://fluence.network/) is excited to sponsor another edition of HackFS and we are looking forward to hack with you July 8 - 27, 2022.

## About Fluence

Fluence provides the protocol, infrastructure and tools to enable decentralized compute for applications and backends on peer-to-peer networks. Nodes in the Fluence peer-to-peer network host discoverable services comprised of WebAssembly Interface Types (IT) modules. Resource discovery is achieved by function addressability rather than REST or JSON-RPC. Aqua, Fluence's purpose-built distributed systems programming language, allows developers to seamlessly program distributed networks and compose hosted services into decentralized applications. As a result, the Fluence protocol and solution stack allows you to quickly and effectively create and implement Web3 protocols and associated governance models within the decentralized serverless paradigm.

## Hacking With Fluence

The Fluence peer-to-peer compute protocol allows you to create decentralized off-chain protocols and applications with ease. In addition to the general pool, Fluence is sponsoring the following named bounties:

### Best use of Fluence off-chain compute -- USDC 3500.00 and USDC 1500.00

* Move complex computations for your Defi/NFT project to off-chain Fluence network
* Plug DAO proposals to trigger off-chain computations
* Build a data processing engine for IPFS/Filecoin
* Any ideas of yours!

### Best P2P protocol using Fluence -- USDC 3500.00 and USDC 1500.00

* Decentralized cross-chain bridge relay for any EVM-based blockchain
* Decentralized access to any decentralized network node RPC
* Decentralized oracle for any blockchain
* Decentralized off-chain governance protocol
* Any other protocol built with Aqua that uses several nodes/services across the network
